**CONVERSATION STRUCTURE - CRITICAL:**
- **External**: CUSTOMER writes FIRST message to BANK. Customer has problem/question. Bank employee responds helpfully. Customer uses first person (I, my, me). Example: "Hi, I'm having trouble with my account..." ‚Üí "I can help you with that!"
- **Internal**: BANK EMPLOYEES discussing work with each other. Colleagues chatting about customers' cases. Use names like Sarah, Megan. Example: "Hey Sarah, Maria Garcia called about..." ‚Üí "Oh yeah, let me check that..."
- **NEVER mix these up!** External = customer speaking, Internal = employees chatting
- Realistic chat messages 10-100 words each
- Natural human conversation flow
- Use contractions, informal tone, emojis occasionally (NOT every message)
- Use EXACT dates provided for each message timestamp
- Consider time gaps between messages for natural conversation flow

**DATE-BASED CONVERSATION FLOW:**
- Use the EXACT dates provided for each message
- CRITICAL: If there are time gaps between messages, create natural conversation breaks
- For day shifts (different dates), ALWAYS start with greetings like:
  * "Good morning!" (for morning messages)
  * "Hey, got an update" (for afternoon/evening messages)
  * "Hi again" (for casual follow-ups)
  * "Following up on our discussion yesterday" (for next-day follow-ups)
  * "Quick update on..." (for urgent matters)
- For same-day gaps (hours apart), use phrases like:
  * "Got an update"
  * "Quick follow-up"
  * "Just checking in"
  * "Hey, just heard back"
- Consider business hours and urgency when crafting messages
- Make conversations feel natural based on the actual timeline
- ALWAYS acknowledge time gaps with appropriate conversation starters
- NEVER continue a conversation across days without acknowledging the time gap

**BANKING:** Realistic EU accounts | Specific amounts | Transaction IDs | Customer details | Authentic banking terminology

- Use contractions (I'm, we're, can't, won't, etc.)

  * Customer emotions: üòÖ (frustration), ü§î (confusion), üòä (thanks), ‚ùì (questions), üòû (disappointed)
  * Bank responses: üëç (confirmation), ‚úÖ (completed), üìß (email), üí≥ (card), üì± (phone)

  * Use 1-2 emojis per message maximum, only where natural

- NEVER use participant names when referring to clients or customers in the conversation content

**ENDING REQUIREMENTS:** {ending_str}

**FOLLOW-UP vs NEXT ACTION DISTINCTION:**
- **follow_up_reason** = "WHY" (the trigger/justification for follow-up)
  * Focus on the REASON/CAUSE that necessitates follow-up
  * Examples: "Customer requested status update", "Documentation incomplete", "Compliance deadline approaching", "Issue unresolved", "Waiting for external approval", "System error occurred"
- **next_action_suggestion** = "WHAT" (the specific step to take)
  * Focus on the CONCRETE ACTION to be performed
  * Examples: "Contact client to request missing documents", "Schedule compliance review meeting", "Escalate to senior management", "Update system with new information", "Send follow-up email to customer", "Review and approve pending application"
