The transfer amount was EUR 5,000.00.\n\nI have noticed a discrepancy in the final amount received by the beneficiary. They have confirmed receiving only PLN 23,500.00, whereas based on the exchange rate at the time of the transfer (approximately 1 EUR = 4.70 PLN), they should have received PLN 23,500.00. I have checked with my local bank, and they confirm the funds were successfully debited from my account.\n\nCould you please investigate this matter and provide an update on the status of the funds? I have attached a copy of the transfer confirmation for your reference.  I understand that FX settlements can sometimes have minor variations, but this appears to be a more significant difference.  I would appreciate a swift resolution to this issue, as it is impacting a time-sensitive business transaction.\n\nPlease let me know if you require any further information from my side.\n\nSincerely,\nJames Davidson\n+49 176 12345678",

This is compounded by a lack of documented escalation procedures for overdue KYC updates. The audit team recommends immediate action to rectify this situation and prevent potential regulatory breaches. \n\nI have already initiated a preliminary investigation and documented the findings in the audit report (reference: IA-KYC-2024-07-18).
