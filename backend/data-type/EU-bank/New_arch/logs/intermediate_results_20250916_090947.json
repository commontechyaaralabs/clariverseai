      "messages.0.body.text.plain": "Dear Shawn Robertson,\n\nI hope this email finds you well.\n\nI am writing to you regarding cross-border transfer reference 789456, initiated on 05/03/2024 from our client, Herr Schmidt, in Germany to his account at Banco Santander in Spain. The transfer amount was EUR 10,000.00.\n\nWe have received confirmation of the transfer from the correspondent bank, but there appears to be a discrepancy in the final amount credited to the beneficiary\u2019s account. The credited amount is EUR 9,875.00, indicating a loss of EUR 125.00. \n\nOur initial investigation suggests a potential issue with the FX rate applied during the conversion. We used the ECB reference rate at the time of the transfer, but we are verifying this with our treasury department. \n\nCould you please investigate this discrepancy from your side? Specifically, could you confirm the FX rate used for the conversion and if there were any additional fees applied that might account for the difference? We need to resolve this quickly for our client, as it impacts their business operations. \n\nPlease provide any supporting documentation you may have, such as the SWIFT message and the internal conversion rate details.\n\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJames Davidson\nSenior International Payments Officer\nEurobank AG\nFrankfurt, Germany",

The finding highlights a lack of consistent application of the enhanced due diligence procedures as outlined in our AML/CTF policy, specifically regarding beneficial ownership verification for entities registered in high-risk jurisdictions.\n\nOur initial investigation indicates that the discrepancies stem from a temporary staffing shortage within the KYC team during the relevant period, coupled with a recent update to the regulatory requirements under the 6th AML Directive. This led to a backlog and, unfortunately, some procedural shortcuts were taken. We have already initiated a retraining program for all KYC staff, focusing on the updated regulations and enhanced due diligence procedures. \n\nI propose we convene a meeting with the Compliance Committee next week to present a detailed remediation plan, including a full review of the affected client files and a timeline for completing the necessary verification steps. I've attached a draft of the remediation plan for your review. Please let me know if you have any initial feedback or would like to discuss this further before the committee meeting. We need to demonstrate to the regulators that we are taking this seriously and have robust controls in place.\n\nBest regards,\n\nVictoria Alvarez\nSenior Compliance Officer\nEurobank AG",
