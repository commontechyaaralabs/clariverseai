# Fixing spaCy/Pydantic Compatibility Issues

## Problem Description

The error you encountered is a classic compatibility issue between spaCy and Pydantic versions:

```
TypeError: ForwardRef._evaluate() missing 1 required keyword-only argument: 'recursive_guard'
```

This happens when you have:
- An older version of Pydantic (v1) 
- A newer version of spaCy that expects Pydantic v2

## Solutions

### Option 1: Fix the Environment (Recommended)

Run one of these scripts to automatically fix the issue:

**Windows Batch:**
```bash
fix_environment.bat
```

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
.\fix_environment.ps1
```

These scripts will:
1. Upgrade pip
2. Uninstall conflicting packages
3. Install compatible versions
4. Download the required spaCy English model

### Option 2: Manual Fix

If you prefer to fix it manually:

```bash
# Activate your virtual environment first
# Then run these commands:

pip install --upgrade pip
pip uninstall spacy pydantic -y
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

### Option 3: Use the Modified Script

The `clustering.py` script has been modified to handle import failures gracefully:
- It will try to import spaCy and gensim
- If they fail, it falls back to basic text processing
- The script will still work, just with reduced functionality

## Testing

Before running the main script, test your imports:

```bash
python test_imports.py
```

This will show you which packages are working and which need to be installed.

## Package Versions

The `requirements.txt` file contains tested compatible versions:
- spacy==3.7.2
- pydantic==2.5.0
- gensim==4.3.2
- hdbscan==0.8.33
- numpy==1.24.3
- pandas==2.0.3
- umap-learn==0.5.5
- scikit-learn==1.3.0

## What Changed

The original script was modified to:
1. Handle import failures gracefully
2. Provide fallback text processing when spaCy is unavailable
3. Skip coherence scoring when gensim is unavailable
4. Continue working with reduced functionality

## Running the Script

After fixing the environment:

```bash
python clustering.py
```

The script will now work even if some optional packages are missing, though with reduced functionality.
