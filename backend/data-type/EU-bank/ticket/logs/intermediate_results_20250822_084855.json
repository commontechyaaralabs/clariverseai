      "description": "At 16/08/2025 20:31, the CoreBanking system on server SRV-PROD-979 triggered a critical alert indicating a failure within the alert notification system. Initial investigation reveals the system is not correctly routing alerts related to transaction failures and customer inquiries. This was detected via monitoring of alert queue saturation. Specifically, transaction TXN51123155, a CHF 47957.94 payment associated with account 356149647887, failed to process correctly, but no alerts were generated for the relevant support teams.  Further analysis shows that the alert system is failing to correctly identify and escalate incidents impacting SEPA payment processing. \n\nThe root cause appears to be a misconfiguration within the alert routing rules, leading to delayed customer response times and potential non-compliance with PSD2 requirements regarding timely transaction updates.  The issue also impacts internal coordination, as support teams are unaware of critical failures.  Attempts to manually trigger alerts via the system interface have failed. The IP address of the affected server is 90.151.142.172. \n\nThis is impacting multiple customer-facing services, including online banking and potentially ATM transactions (ATM-2925 at branch BR1260 may be affected due to delayed status updates). The error code ERR_4802 is consistently logged in the alert system logs.  Given the potential for significant financial impact and regulatory non-compliance (specifically regarding GDPR data subject access requests related to transaction status), immediate escalation is required.  Initial troubleshooting steps include reviewing the alert routing configuration and verifying connectivity to the alert notification service.  A rollback to the previous configuration is recommended. We must also consider the implications for Basel III operational risk and EBA guidelines on system availability.

The affected customer is CID972537, and the transaction originated from IP address 129.247.148.141. While no direct financial loss has been confirmed, the inaccurate calculation presents a significant operational risk and potential for misreporting to the ECB. \n\nFurther investigation is required to determine the root cause of the calculation error. We suspect a potential data synchronization issue between the OnlineBanking system and the risk management platform. Immediate action is needed to validate the hedging model and ensure accurate risk reporting. A rollback of the transaction is not advised at this stage due to potential SEPA payment implications and the need to maintain transaction integrity. \n\nEscalation to the Quantitative Analytics team is recommended.

System ATMNetwork on server SRV-PROD-324 flagged a potentially fraudulent withdrawal originating from ATM ATM-6296 at branch BR2473. Transaction TXN47628494 for account 161426474685 involved a withdrawal of CHF 37357.33. Initial analysis indicates a possible social engineering attack preceding the transaction, as the withdrawal amount is significantly higher than the customer's typical usage pattern. The ATM reported no hardware errors, but the transaction triggered a high-risk score due to the amount and location. IP address 18.229.213.78 associated with the ATM session is under investigation.  We are observing potential indicators of identity theft, requiring immediate action to prevent further fraudulent activity.  The transaction is currently held for review.  This incident potentially violates GDPR Article 33 (data breach notification) and PSD2 requirements regarding strong customer authentication.  Furthermore, the substantial amount involved necessitates adherence to Basel III operational risk guidelines.  We must also consider potential implications under the EBA guidelines for system availability and the ECB requirements for payment systems, as this impacts SEPA transactions.  Immediate steps include freezing account 161426474685, initiating a full fraud investigation, and contacting the customer to verify the transaction.
